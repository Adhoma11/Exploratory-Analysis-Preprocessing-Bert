# Exploratory-Analysis-Preprocessing-Bert
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster.

**For example:** 
The author explicitly uses the word “ABLAZE” but means it metaphorically. This is clear to a human right away, especially with the visual aid. But it’s less clear to a machine.

In this competition, I will build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.
I will have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified.
